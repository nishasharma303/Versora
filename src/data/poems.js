    content: `In the race to leave others behind\n
I crave to recreate the memories we left behind.\n
Reminiscing the beauty of those unsaid words of affection\n
The smiles we exchanged,\n
the warmth we shared,\n
the innocence we cherished.\n
The shoulder to lean on even though for seconds\n
were the moments we lived,\n
The moments we crave.`

     content: `
The feeling of being with you is still the same,\n
Even though we meet after days.\n
Many became the reason of smile\n
But you feel the serenity of life.\n
How can you think you lost the space\n
In this little heart,\n
It even trembles in having a thought of being apart.\n `},
 
{ id: 3, title: "No one to Someone", tagline: "the stars wants us to gaze them again...", language: "English", 
    content: `You were No-one\n
when you made my heart flutter\n
Still this heart ached,\n
when I couldn't find you.\n
I missed your gentle touch\n
the way you made love,\n
when you took me in your hands\n
and your eyes spoke those words.\n
The rose you tucked in my hair\n
still smells the same,\n
even the stars wants us\n
to gaze them again.\n
Now, you are Someone\n
my eyes look for,\n
and my heart waits\n
to dance with you in rain.\n` },

  content: `A longing to forget all the worries\n
in the aroma of moist soil,\n
and bring back the innocence\n
which we left behind.\n
An urge to hold your hand\n
while the breeze passes by,\n
under the roaring clouds\n
with a feeling of conscience.\n
A little wish to feel the chill\n
when the drop touches our skin,\n
washing down the years of separation\n
with just a walk in rain.\n` },
  
{ id: 5, title: "Tumhara Saath", tagline: "Haath tham lo mera yuhi...", language: "Hindi", 
     content: `Vo safar hi kya jisme tum sath na ho\n
Vo khushi hi kya jiski vajah Tum na ho,\n
kya karu unn yaadon ka jisme Tumhari muskurahat na ho\n
Vo kalam hi kya Jisne na napa ho un aankho ki gehraiyo ko.\n
Un do palo ko mai sanjo ke rakhlu \n
Jab mera naam tumhari labo par ho,\n
khwahisho ke sandook me, Bas chah hai tumhare sath ki\n
Sapno me hi sahi, Hath tham lo mera yuhi.\n` },

{ id: 6, title: "Yaadein", tagline: "Ek mulakaat ki tammana...", language: "Hindi", 
  content: `Gujrte hue us raste se\n
yaad aate vo pal,\n
jisme muskurate hue humne\n
Gungunaye the do labz.\n
Aaj vahi shaam hai\n
Aur vahi hai vo jagah,\n
Par thamne ko vo hath nahi\n
Aur na khilkhane ki vajah.\n
Na socha tha kabhi\n
ye lamhe yaadon me simat ke\n
reh jayegi,\n
Aur ek mulakaat ki tammana\n
Yu khwaahish ban jayegi.` },

  content: `Dil kar raha hai\n
un adhuri dastaano ke panno ko\n
aaj phir palatne ka,\n
aur un ankahi khwahishon ki\n 
guzaarish ko sunne ka.\n
In aankhon ki nami mein\n
jo yaadein basi hain,\n
un yaadon mein kahin phir gum ho jaane ka.\n
jin palon ko maine yu hi guzarne diya\n
unhe aaj phir jee lene ka,\n
Dil kar raha hai mera\n
aaj sirf dil ki sunne ka.` },

{ id: 8, title: "Khwahish", tagline: "Talaash hai un nigaaho ki...", language: "Hindi", 
  content: `Ek jhalak ki aas liye\n
talash hai un nigahon ki,\n
jinhe dekhkar yeh dil kabhi na bhara\n
aur wajah bani muskurane ki.\n
Khwahish thi ek chhoti si\n
ki tham jaaye woh pal,\n
in baaton mein yu gum ho jaane ka mauka\n
mile na mile kal.\n
Na jaao in baaton ko\n
aise adhuri chhodkar\n
yeh kahani bhi na chhoot jaaye\n
yu hi kahi kisi mod par...` },
